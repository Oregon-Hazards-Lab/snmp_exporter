# APC/Schneider UPS Network Management Cards
#
# Note: older management cards only support SNMP v1 (AP9606 and
# AP9607, possibly others). Older versions of the firmware may only
# support v1 as well. If you only have newer cards you can switch to
# version v2c or v3.
#
# The management cards have relatively slow processors so don't poll
# very often and give a generous timeout to prevent spurious
# errors. Alternatively you can eliminate the interface polling (OIDs
# beginning with 1.3.6.1.2.1) to reduce the time taken for polling.
